###Overview: 
Vivi-fi is a recent start-up organized by ASU alumni, to link event planners with musical 
ensembles and solo musicians. The benefit the service provides is an easier way for event planners to find
and book quality performers.

###TO_DO:
		1.) Index Page
			Create an Index page where event planners can navigate the main menu to search for 
			ensembles, search for solo musicians, build an ensemble, or contact Vivi-fi to book 
			an ensemble or solo musician.
			
			The group recommends that a future version include an events link that administrators 
			can access to monitor they're booking history, and possibly help planners promote 
			public events.
			
		2.) Database
			Design database of ensembles and solo musicians for the planners to search through. 
			Database will be populated by site administrators. Administrators also need to be 
			able to search the database for contact info, which will not be accessible to the 
			public.
		
		3.) Contact Page
			This page allows planners to contact the client to book ensembles or solo musicians. 
			This page will also include a link for new artists to apply for Vivi-fi's service.
			
		4.) Administrator Page
			This page will be used by the administrators to access new artist applications. 
			It will also be where the administrators can access contact information from their
			clients.
		
		5.) Ensemble Search Page
			Allows planners to search the database of already formed ensembles. The planner will 
			be able to filter the results  based on genre, name, instruments or rate. When a row 
			item is clicked it will link to that ensembles personal page.
		
		6.) Ensemble Personal Page
			This page will allow planners to view various information about the ensemble. 
			Information will include: name, genre, instruments, rate, pictures, an audio 
			clip, and video clip. Contact information is kept private. 
			
		7.) Solo Musician Search Page
			Similar to ensemble page but to limit results to solo musicians.
			
		8.) Build-a-Ensemble Page
			Will allow planners to search individual musicians, to build a custom ensemble.
		
		9.) Event Page (v2.0)
			This page might allow planners to promote public events, which feature ensembles 
			booked through Vivi-fi. This page could be potentially used for administrators to 
			access information regarding events (i.e. artist, event, planner information).
