Sprint Backlog
=======

    1.) Index Page

        Create an Index page where event planners can navigate the main menu to search for 
        ensembles, search for solo musicians, build an ensemble, or contact Vivifi to book 
        an ensemble or solo musician.

        The group recommends that a future version include an events link that administrators 
        can access to monitor they're booking history, and possibly help planners promote 
        public events.

            Tasks:
                Create Index Page
                Create 4 buttons
                        Artists - search solo artists
                        Ensemble - search ensembles
                        Ask Us - contact page, artist registration
                        Vivibook - quick booking, ensemble building page
                About Us Page link

    2.) About Us Page

        This page allows planners and musicians to view information about that company and 
        links to the artists registration page.
            
            Tasks:
                Create a page to display the Mission Statement

    3.) Contact Page

        This page will also include a link for new artists to apply for Vivifi's service.
