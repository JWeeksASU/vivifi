Information Radiator Proposal

Feature: 
	A link on the admin page that will display what advertising medium is pulling in the most users.

Purpose:
	The purpose of this feature is to allow tracking of where artists/ensembles and planners are 
	learning about the site, to better understand what advertising mediums are most effective. This 
	information can help Vivifi with their future marketing plans, by creating a visualization of what 
	current advertisements, if any, are actually bringing in their desired users.

Design:
	This feature can be coded into the main artist/ensemble and planner registration pages. The 
	question can be added to the current form as a set of radio buttons or list where artists and 
	planners can indicate what brought them to the site. When the user submits the form, the 
	selected option would be stored in the database along with the rest of the users data. The
	current plan is to develop the database using MySQL or Ajax. Since, we are in the process of 
	setting up the database, adding this feature wouldnâ€™t add a lot of time or man power to the 
	development process. A few queries would need to be written to access and sort the information.
	The resulting output would be a printable spreadsheet or table displaying the advertisement 
	options ranked greatest to least. 

Estimated Time: 8 hours, 1 person
